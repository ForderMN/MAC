App Description(what it does)
Forder is a mobile app that provides both restaurants, food trucks and consumers a platform. This platform allows restaurants and food trucks to post their menus with pictures (maybe video later) and receive orders from customer. Meanwhile, customer can search and order foods through the app, which will notify the vendor when the customer will arrive to dine in or pickup the food.

App Design (how will it work)
Since this app is first design for the Mobile App Challenge at University of California, Merced, we hope this app can help UC Merced students to save more lunch time instead of waiting 30 mins in line for food. We also hope this app can help UC Merced Dinning Center to become more efficient.

Users (who it is designed for)
There are two different groups of users. One is catering business owners. It can help them to manage the orders received, and be prepared before the customer arrives. Another target group of users is general consumersï¼Œwhich they can order food on Forder conveniently.

Impact (how it is going to help society)
Traditionally, when people come to the restaurants, they order food from menu and then wait the food. However, these steps make restaurants become less efficient due to space usage and time lost. Though Forder, searching restaurants and ordering can be easily performed through the app with internet connection. It will benefit the customers receiving their food earlier at higher quality. Moreover, restaurants can become more hassle free also allowing them to collect data ( comments/feedback, time distributions, popularity, ingredients consumptions, etc). With those data, restaurant owners can host their business more professionally. In conclusion, Forder create a win-win situation for both food business owners as well as the customers.
