## App Description(what it does)
Forder is a mobile app that provides both restaurants, food trucks and consumers a platform. This
platform allows restaurants and food trucks to post their menus with pictures (maybe video later)
and receive orders from customer. Meanwhile, customer can search and order foods and tell
restaurants when they arrive to restaurants or pick food.

## App Design (how will it work)
Since this app is first design for the Mobile App Challenge at University of California, Merced,
we hope this app can help UC Merced students to save more time for their lunch time, instead of
waiting for 30 mins for food. We also hope this app can help UC Merced Dinning Center to be more
efficient.

## Users (who it is designed for)
There are two different groups of users. One is catering business managers. They can manage receive
orders and ready to serve consumers before customer arrived. Another group of users is customerï¼Œ
they can order food on Forder.

## Impact (how it is going to help society)
Usually, people come to the restaurants, they order food from menu and wait the food. However, these
steps make restaurants become less efficient to space usage and waste customer' time. Though Forder,
searching restaurants and ordering will be much faster and customer can no longer waste time on
waiting food. Moreover, restaurants can manage spacing more efficiently and easily to collect data (
comments, time distributions, popularity, ingredients consumptions, etc). With thosedata, restaurant
owners can manage their business more reasonably. In conclusion, Forder create a win-win situation
for both food business owners and customer.
